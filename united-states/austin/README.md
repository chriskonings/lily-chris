### Open 24 Hours
> Chris and I often worked late nights as part of our training in Austin but both really hated being stuck in the office all day. So in light of Austin's many 24 hour establishments, we tried to work from a new one together each time we worked overtime. - Lily

- [x] [Magnolia Cafe](http://www.magnoliacafeaustin.com/) :fire:

> We first found this place after a hot afternoon of paddleboarding on the river and the lot of us (there must've been 15 people altogether) took up a table the length of the entire cafe. I managed to sit across from Chris (pre-boyfriend, post-crush) and order a Tuna Pecan Salad. We had a fun conversation about getting tattoos together before the summer ended. We never followed through with those tattoos but we went back to that cafe obsessively after, enjoying each other and their late night omelettes. - Lily
